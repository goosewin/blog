Solving problems is important. Perhaps, the most important skill anyone can have really. Whether you're a software developer, an entrepreneur, or a writer, I believe the technic I'm about to describe is a neat lifehack anyone can use when tackling challengig problems. Meet rubber duck debugging.

## Definition

**Rubber duck debugging**—_yeah, it's as quirky as it sounds_—is a classic problem-solving trick coming from the niche of software development. The practice is rooted in the idea that articulating your thought process out loud helps you pinpoint the root of the issue you might have been missing all along.

This technique isn't just for coders. I've found it to be incredibly useful in all sorts of situations where I'm banging my head against a wall.

### How Do I Rubberduck?

Rubber duck debugging is incredibly straightforward:

> 1. Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).
> 2. Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that’s all right.
> 3. Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by line.
> 4. At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing. The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way.

Over time, I realized that carrying around a rubber duck everywhere isn't exactly practical. So, I started internalizing the duck—talking to myself or occasionally venting to a patient colleague.

This method works wonders outside of software development too. So, here's the simplified version:

1. Carefully define the problem you're facing.
2. Explain the issue and what you've tried so far, either to yourself or someone else.
3. In the process, you'll often uncover the solution or at least the next step.
4. Implement your newfound strategy and marvel at the power of rubberducking.

You'd be amazed at how often this works.

## Why Is It So Effective?

When you take the time to explain your problem and attempted approaches in detail, you're forced to slow down and think critically about each part. You become more likely to reinforce your comprehension of the problem and pinpoint possible oversights.

Now, I'm no psychologist, but I believe that rubberducking works due to humans being social creatures. We are hardwired to communicate and share our thoughts and ideas. Explaining your problem to someone (or... something) taps into this innate need to externalize thoughts.

## When Should I Rubberduck?

Simple answer: whenever you're stuck. Duh!

Seriously though, rubberducking has been a lifesaver for me. It's made me more self-reliant—I don't have to bug my colleagues or mentors as often. The duck's got my back.

## How Do I Get Into Rubberducking?

### Step 1: Meet Your New Best Friend

First things first—get yourself a duck. Sure, any object will do, but there's something charming about the classic rubber duck.

- Pick a rubber duck that makes you grin—maybe a pirate duck, a superhero duck, whatever fits your style.
- Keep it on your desk where you can see it. Let it be a constant reminder to use the technique.

### Step 2: Start Building a Habit

Make rubberducking a regular part of your routine.

- Kick off your day by explaining yesterday's work to your duck.
- Before you ping someone for help, have a chat with your duck first.

### Step 3: Practice Being Thorough

Always give your duck the full rundown.

- The more detailed you are, the better.
- Imagine the duck is asking you questions. It might feel weird, but it helps get to the root of the problem faster.

## Last Thoughts

At the end of the day, rubber duck debugging is a ridiculously simple yet powerful way to improve up your problem-solving. Give it a try—you can become a more effective decision maker in no time.
