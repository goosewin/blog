      'Tech should compound human agency and progress, not harvest attention for ad markets. How we got here and how to fix it.',

Tech should accelerate humans. It's doing the opposite.

Somewhere along the line, we took a wrong turn. We turned attention into a commodity and user data into an asset class. We invented systems that optimized for balance sheets instead of people. As a result, internet exists to keep you scrolling, not growing.

This pisses me off because the opportunity cost is massive. If the last twenty years humanity had optimized for agency over engagement, we'd be decades ahead in education, health, coordination, and real problem-solving. We traded progress for dollars and pageviews.

## The Great Bait-and-Switch

Original pitch: Connect the world. Democratize information. Empower anyone to build.

What we actually built:
- Engagement as product; attention as commodity
- Time-on-site as success; time-to-outcome as afterthought
- Default-on tracking; default-off transparency
- Frictionless entry; high-friction exit
- "Personalization" that's actually behavioral arbitration in an ad auction

As it often happens, we optimized for what we measured; and we measured the wrong things.

## What This Cost Us

As I've worked across startups, enterprise, different industries and cultures, I've noticed the following implications:

- Skill development comes to a halt. You get a world of content consumers, incapable of creating something of their own.

- Thinking gets shallow. Infinite novelty kills depth, and, as a result, people forget how to think and learn.

- Coordination tax explodes. Businesses build closed ecosystems, which leads to collaboration and interoperability becoming an artifact of the past.

- Incentives misalign. Users pay with attention, while value accrues elsewhere. The product isn't serving you; **you're serving it**.

As a result of retention becoming the core objective of businesses worldwide, human progress becomes a byproduct at best.

After years of bouncing between companies and industries, I've found one definition that personally inspires me to do my best work in technology:

## Parting Thoughts

### For Builders

You don't need permission to start.
- Replace one engagement KPI with a progress KPI
- Add an off-ramp after success; make your user close the app and go do something meaningful
- Optimize experiences to shorten the path from intent to outcome

### For Users

Audit your data intake. I wrote about this in [my signal-to-noise article](/blog/signal-to-noise-crisis-2025); cut high-noise sources ruthlessly.
- Keep tools that make you faster, smarter, better. Cut the rest.
- Pay for products that respect your time. Free often isn't really free.
- Turn off non-human notifications. Batch everything else.

## Why This Matters

It's honestly sad that tech, the most powerful leverage we've ever created, gets used primarily to distract us.

If you're building, take a critical look at the net impact of your work. Not on your company. Not on your career. On the world.

Technology amplifies whatever it touches. Aim it at engagement, you get distraction. Aim it at human capability, you get progress.

We don't have to accept an internet that enriches a few while hollowing out human attention. We can build, and choose, systems that compound agency.

The stakes are too high to optimize for the wrong things.
